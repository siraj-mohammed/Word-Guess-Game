# Word-Guess-Game aka Hangman

This is a JS/HTML version of the Hangman game
To win the game, the user must correctly guess all the letters in a randomly-generated word.
Letters are revealed as they're correctly guessed.

Incorrect guesses are also displayed. The user is allowed to guess incorrectly only 10 times.
At the 10th attempt, if all the letters have not been correctly guessed, the game is lost.
